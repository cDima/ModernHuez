<p>When you use the Ambieye Properties, you may provide us with
personally identifiable information about you and your company, such as your
company name, your name, title, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone

any Personal Information from you when you use the Ambieye Properties unless
you provide it voluntarily (for example, by signing up for an Account,

by you or otherwise available to or held by Ambieye.</p>
<p>Where applicable, if you choose to access, or log in to, any
Ambieye Properties using your Google, Facebook, Yahoo, or other accounts

with us certain Personal Information and Other Information. This information

<p>We also use third party analytics products, including the
following, to collect Other Information and augment Information:</p>
<p>Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics, a web analytics
service provided by Google, Inc., to evaluate your use of the Ambieye
Properties, compile reports on activity, and provide other services relating to
Internet usage. Google Analytics uses first-party cookies that store
information, such as what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor
has been to the Sites before, and what site referred the visitor to the web
page.</p>
<p>We have also implemented Display Advertising Remarketing
with Google Analytics to advertise online. This means that third-party vendors,
including Google, display our ads on sites across the Internet and that we and
third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the
Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick
cookie, see: http://www.google.com/doubleclick) together to inform, optimize,
and serve ads based on your past visits to the Ambieye Properties.</p>
<p>Google classifies Google Analytics data as confidential
information, governed by Google's privacy policies. Google's privacy policy can
be viewed at http://www.google.com/intl/None/policies/privacy/.</p>
<p>By using the Ambieye Properties, you consent to the
processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set
out above. If you choose, you can opt out of the processing of data about you
by Google for Display Advertising and/or customize the ads by using Google's Ads
Settings at:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads">http://www.google.com/settings/ads</a>.
You can opt out of the processing of data about you by Google generally by
turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your browser, or by downloading
and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to
indicate that information about the visit to the applicable Ambieye Property
should not be sent to Google Analytics. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser
Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to the applicable Ambieye
Property itself or to other web analytics services. For more information on
Google Analytics, please visit <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">https://www.google.com/analytics/</a>.</p>

By means of this tool, we can track the actions of users after they have

effectiveness of the Facebook advertisements for statistical and market
research purposes. The data acquired in this way remains anonymous to us, i.e.
we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this information
is stored and processed by Facebook; we will keep you informed of such use as much
as possible. Facebook may connect this information to your Facebook account and
use it for its own marketing purposes in accordance with Facebook's own data

possible for Facebook and its partners to display advertisements within and
outside of Facebook. In addition, a cookie may be stored on your computer for
this purpose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How long does Ambieye save my personal information and how

servers for as long as you remain an Ambieye customer in order to provide you
with the services. You can access, amend or delete your personal information
from Ambieye's servers through the controls in your account. Because of the way
we maintain certain services, after your information is deleted, backup copies
may linger for some time before they are deleted, and we may retain certain
data for a longer period of time if we are required to do so for legal reasons.</p>

sharing your information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We use industry-standard methods to keep this information
safe and secure while it is transmitted over your home network and through the
Internet to our cloud servers. Depending on your location and type of data Ambieye
may process your personal information on servers that are not in your home
country.</p>
<p>In what circumstances does Ambieye share my information?</p>
<p>Under no circumstance do we share personal information for
any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the delivery of Ambieye
Products and services without asking you first. </p>
<p>The following are the limited situations where we may share
personal information:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li >With
your consent: We may share personal information when we have your consent.
One example of this would be if you sign up for programs offered by our
partners. If you do this, we may share certain information with the
partner. This could include things like status of your device. Similarly,
when you connect third-party devices and services to your Ambieye
Products, you are shown information about any proposed exchange of data.
Your explicit consent is required to allow this exchange on your behalf
and you can change your mind at any time.</li>
<li >Business
Transitions: Upon the sale or transfer of the company and/or all or part
of its assets, your personal information may be among the items sold or

statement in place at the time of its collection.</li>
<li >For
legal reasons: We may provide information to a third party if we believe

laws (or the applicable laws of foreign countries other than the United
States).</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share non-personal information (for example,
aggregated or anonymized customer data) publicly and with our partners. For
example, we may, publish trends about use. This information may also be shared
with other users to help them maximize Ambieye community usefulness or help us
generally improve our system. We may also share this information with
companies, for example, if they are interested in providing demand-response
services. We take steps to keep this non-personal information from being
associated with you and we require our partners to do the same.</p>
<p>Your personal information may be collected, processed and
stored by Ambieye or its service providers in the United States and other
countries where our servers reside. As a result, your personal information may
be subject to legal requirements, including lawful requirements to disclose
personal information to government authorities, in those jurisdictions.</p>
<p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>
